# Consensus Algorithms and their corresponding Engines

I got inspiration of implemnting consensus algorithms from this [Hyperledger blog post](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2019/01/11/floating-the-sawtooth-raft-implementing-a-consensus-algorithm-in-rust)! 

The Avalanche consensus algorithm is implemented here
The Paxos consensus algorithm can be implemented as an exercise refering from here - https://noghartt.dev/blog/paxos-made-simple-with-rust/
